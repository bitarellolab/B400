This tutorial guides you through installing FASTE and FASTQ.


## 1. Install FASTQE

Activate your b216 conda environment:

```{bash, eval=F}
conda activate b216
```

Install [fastqe](https://fastqe.com/):
```{bash, eval=F}
conda install -c bioconda/label/cf201901 fastp #
```

If there were no error messages, test that it worked:

```{bash, eval=F}
fastqe
```

```{bash, eval=F}
Filename        Statistic       Qualities
Processing FASTQ file from stdin, press Ctrl-C to cancel. fastqe --help for more info
```

IF you see that, it's a good sign! You can always cancel something that's running by pressing control+c

## 2. Install FASTP

```{bash, eval=F}
conda install -c bioconda fastp
```


## 3. Download input files for fastqe

Manually download the file fastq.zip from our [Moodle page](https://moodle.brynmawr.edu/pluginfile.php/211780/mod_folder/content/0/fastq.zip):


Copy the file from your downloads folder into the current directory
```{bash, eval=F}

cp ~/Downloads/fastq.zip . # "." means "this directory"
`
#check

ls
```

Check that the file is in your directory
```{bash, eval=F}
ls -l #this flag makes the file be listed in a list-like way
```

Unzip the file

```{bash,eval=F}
unzip fastq.zip
```

## The end!
