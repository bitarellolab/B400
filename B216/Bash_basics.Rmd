# Command-line basics!


Hi everyone! 

This will be a very soft introduction to the command-line.

I am assuming you are using either a Mac or a Linux machine.


1. What is "the shell"?

Read this [5 min tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro/index.html) and then come back here!


Now you know what it is! It is a computer program that allows you to "talk" to your computer and give it tasks. But you need to speak its language!

2. Why should I use one?

It may not seem worth your while to run a program ONCE using the command-line, but when you find yourself contemplating manually repeating a computational task 100 times, the appeal becomes clear!

* high action-to-keystroke ratio
* support for automating repetitive tasks
* capacity to access networked machines.

#Getting started

In your personal or lab computer, go to the "Terminal" application. Tip: if you don't know where to find it, open Finder and search for it. 

Once you open it, run the "path to working directory" command:

```{bash}
pwd
```
Q1. What does this show you?

Move to your desktop folder by using the "change directory command". Type:

```{bash}
cd ~/Desktop #the "~" is a shortcut that means "home directory".
#everything written after "#" is ignored by the shell, which is why we write commands after "#" when writing code.
```

Q2. What do you think the above command does?

Check your guess by using the pwd command again to check where you are:

```{bash}
pwd
```
